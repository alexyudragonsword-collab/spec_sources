"""spec_sources: numbers about the outside world -- specification clauses,
paper and datasheet figures, and what is derived from them alone -- each with
its provenance, plus the reader and the guards.  No simulation.

The reader is :mod:`.reader`; this module re-exports its public names, which
are a superset of mmw60_trx's ``mmw60.spec`` (``SpecNumber``, ``SOURCES``,
``load_table``, ``all_entries``, ``survey``, ``value``, ``unverified``,
``by_source``) plus :func:`ref`.  The package is vendored as it is: relative
imports only, data next to the code, PyYAML the only dependency.
